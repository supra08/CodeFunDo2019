Incentive driven employee appraisal system with voting on blockchain.


# Proposal

### Idea
Most of the companies have a complaints portal or a consumer forum. But what about positive feedback or an appraisal forum that keeps a track of all the achievements and milestones achieved by the employee or any good works done by them? It will definitely become quite easy for employees to redeem bonuses and confirm leave requests. Moreover, it becomes quite easier on the managerial side to rate and generate a report of the employees for their accomplishments. It can boast a voting system with a backend on Ethereum block chain to enforce reliability on the votes on employees.
  

### Solution
We are developing a software system which provides a platform to the employees where they can post about the milestones or accomplishments they or any other co-worker have achieved on a daily basis and then public **voting** is done on that posts to check the genuinity of the posts. These votes also decide the **crypto-tokens** that the employee is achieving for the work he has done. All the **posts and the voting is to be maintained on a public blockchain** so that no central authority can tamper and misuse their power. It brings transparency to the system. A **leaderboard** is maintained to track the crypto-tokens of all the employees. The managers can then interact with the platform to figure out the work performance of all the employees. 

### Flow of the Software
* The review system has been made decentralized, so no one can tamper with the actual data.
* There is a system of voting which has been implemented using smart contracts in blockchain. This cross verifies the posted achievement or the appraisal, preventing any case of forgery. 
* And then we have our credit system, using our own custom currency, the 'Prisma'. Any user who gets more than a certain amount of upvotes, is credited with 10 or 20 prismas. These prismas can be redeemed for further benefits. 
* There is also a leaderboard which shows the employees with the maximum prismas, upvotes and maximum number of posts. 

Besides, the fact that it is decentralized makes it stands out as it makes the ranking fair and transparent. Thus, it has attempted to successfully gamify the appraisal system while keeping secure.
